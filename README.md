## To update:

1. Confirm that the box above my username says "master." If it says "dev," click on the box and select "master" from the dropdown. This ensures that you'll be getting the code I've finalized.

2. Click on the name of the Python file above (word_puzzles.py). This will take you to a new page where you can see the raw Python code.
3. Click the copy button in the top right. When you hover your mouse over this button, it will say "Copy raw file."
4. Open up Visual Studio Code. Open the version of the Python file that's saved on your computer, if it isn't already open.
5. Click anywhere in the code editor pane (the pane above the terminal, where you can see the raw code).
6. Use command + A to highlight the entire contents of the file, and then hit command + V to paste the new code in its place.
7. Save the changes with command + S. You are now free to either close Visual Studio Code, or run the script and search more words!
